# What is TGN - Minecraft
Honestly, it's a failed project from over a year ago. It's not really meant to be anything serious, and the project will likely be renamed shortly. The original intend of the project was to create (from scratch) a pvp game manager, due to several problems during 2018/19 regarding PGM servers.

In 2020, the project is being toyed with again (however, no promises!!) and will use ATLAS game manager developed by several on the Avicus Repository (can be access by clicking the fork links). The objective of this project I'm toying with is to provide a more modern feel to a classic game.
